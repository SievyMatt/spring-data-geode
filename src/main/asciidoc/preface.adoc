= Preface

_Spring Data Geode_ focuses on integrating the _Spring Framework's_ powerful, non-invasive programming model
and concepts with Apache Geode to simplify configuration and development of Java applications using Geode.

This document assumes the reader already has a basic familiarity with the _Spring Framework_ and Apache Geode
concepts and APIs.

While every effort has been made to ensure this documentation is comprehensive and complete, with no errors,
some topics are beyond the scope of this document and may require more explanation (e.g. data distribution management
with partitioning for HA while still preserving consistency).  Additionally, some typos might have crept in.
If you do spot mistakes or even more serious errors and you can spare a few cycles, please do bring these issues
to the attention of the _Spring Data Geode_ team by raising an appropriate
https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAGEODE[issue].

Thank you.
