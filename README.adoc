= Spring Data for Apache Geode

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire[Spring Data for Apache Geode] project is to
make it easier to build highly scalable, _Spring_ powered applications using https://geode.apache.org/[Apache Geode]
as the underlying distributed, in-memory data management platform.

= Examples

For examples on using the _Spring Data for Apache Geode_, see the
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-gemfire-examples[spring-gemfire-examples] project.

= Getting Help

Read the main project https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/[website] along with the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/docs/current/reference/html/[User Guide].

Look at the source code and the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/docs/current/api/[JavaDocs].

For more detailed questions, visit https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-data-gemfire[StackOverflow].

If you are new to _Spring_ as well as _Spring Data for Apache Geode_, look for information about
https://spring.io/projects[Spring projects].

== Quick Start

For those in a hurry:

*

Download the jar through

*

Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-geode</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>

<!-- nightly builds -->
<repository>
  <id>spring-maven-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Maven SNAPSHOT Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
  <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
</repository>

<!-- milestones/release candidates-->
<repository>
  <id>spring-maven-milestone</id>
  <name>Spring Maven Milestone Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
</repository>
----

* Gradle:
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
   mavenRepo name: "spring-snapshot", urls: "https://repo.spring.io/snapshot"
   mavenRepo name: "spring-milestone", urls: "https://repo.spring.io/milestone"
   mavenRepo name: "spring-plugins" , urls: "https://repo.spring.io/plugins-release"
}

dependencies {
   compile "org.springframework.data:spring-data-geode:${version}"
}
----

* Configure a Geode cache and Region (REPLICATE, PARTITION and so on):
[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:gfe="http://www.springframework.org/schema/geode"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/geode https://www.springframework.org/schema/geode/spring-geode.xsd">

  <gfe:cache/>

  <gfe:partitioned-region id="ExampleRegion" copies="2">

  <bean id="gemfireTemplate" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.GemfireTemplate" p:region-ref="ExampleRegion"/>
</beans>
----

* Use the Region to read/write data:
[source,java]
----
region.put(Long.valueOf(1), new Person("Jane", "Smith"));
----

* And/Or `GemFireTemplate` to interact with Geode:
[source,java]
----
template.query("person = 1");
----

= Building

_Spring Data for Apache Geode_ uses Maven as its build system. To compile the project, simply type from the root folder

[source]
----
mvn clean install
----

= Contributing

Here are some ways for you to get involved in the community:

* Get involved with the Spring community on the Spring Community Forums (now on StackOverflow).
Please help out on the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-data-gemfire[forum]
by responding to questions and joining the debate.
* Create https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF[JIRA] tickets for bugs and new features and comment and vote on the bugs
you are interested in.
* GitHub is for social coding. If you want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests
from https://help.github.com/forking/[forks of this repository]. If you want to contribute code this way,
please reference a JIRA ticket as well covering the specific issue you are addressing.
* Watch for upcoming articles on Spring by https://spring.io/blog[subscribing] to spring.io.

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[sign the Contributor License Agreement]. Signing the contributorâ€™s agreement
does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions,
and you will get an author credit if we do. If you forget to do so, you'll be reminded when you submit a pull request.
Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.

= Running CI tasks locally

Since this pipeline is purely Docker-based, it's easy to:

* Debug what went wrong on your local machine.
* Test out a a tweak to your `test.sh` script before sending it out.
* Experiment against a new image before submitting your pull request.

All of these use cases are great reasons to essentially run what the CI server does on your local machine.

IMPORTANT: To do this you must have Docker installed on your machine.

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-data-geode-github adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-data-geode-github`.
+
2. `cd spring-data-geode-github`
+
Next, run your tests from inside the container:
+
3. `./mvnw clean dependency:list test -Dsort` (or whatever profile you need to test out)

Since the container is binding to your source, you can make edits from your IDE and continue to run build jobs.

If you test building the artifact, do this:

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-data-geode-github adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-data-geode-github`.
+
2. `cd spring-data-geode-github`
+
Next, try to package everything up from inside the container:
+
3. `./mvnw -Pci,snapshot -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean package`

NOTE: Docker containers can eat up disk space fast! From time to time, run `docker system prune` to clean out old images.
